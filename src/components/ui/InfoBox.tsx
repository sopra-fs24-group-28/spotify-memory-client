          <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
          <p>In this twist to the classical boardgame memory, players select one of their Spotify playlists to be the content of a deck of cards.</p>
          <p>
            In turns, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they match, then that player wins the pair and plays again. 
            If they do not match, they are turned face down again and play passes to the next player.
            The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the player with the most pairs.
