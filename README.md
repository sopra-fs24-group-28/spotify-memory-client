## Introduction

By combining `concentration game` with music, Spotimemory creates a competitive and fun game to play among friends.
This is the repository of the front-end part of our implementation, you'll find the back-end part of our
application [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-server).

## Technologies

The client is written in TypeScript and JavaScript using React.

We used REST communication to communicate between the front and backend for basic communication. In order to get a
smooth in game experience, stomp websockets were used.

## High-level components

The [Login screen](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/Login.tsx)
allows users to log in with their spotify credentials. Upon successfull login (spotify premium acoount required) the user can enjoy the main part of our application:

The [LobbyOverview](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyOverview.tsx)
allows the users to either create a new lobby or join an existing one.
When creating a new lobby the role of the player changes to `host`. The user can thus define various game parameters
in [the customization view](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/CustomizeGameParameter.tsx)
such as the game mode, the number of cards, number of decks etc. In
addition, the host can choose one of his personal playlists for this round. So make sure that you already have a playlist in your spotify account.
After customising, the lobby is visible for other players and can be joined by them. These players can already see who is in the respective lobby and what playlist is set.
Joining a lobby leads to a rerouting to the [lobby waiting room](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyWaitingRoom.tsx) which is an
intermediate place where the host can wait until all his
friends joined the lobby.

The host can decide to start a round by pressing `start` in
the [LobbyWaitingRoom](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyWaitingRoom.tsx).
This will reroute all users to
the [GameScreen](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameScreen.tsx).

Depending on the game customization settings the active player now pick a facedown card, listen to the respective songs (or inspect the
albumcover) and try to match pairs.
All other observing players can consume the same content at the same time thanks to our websockets.
Whenever the active player matches two or more correct cards he or she will get another chance.
Besides the actual game, all players can see the current scoreboard. 

The game ends when the last set of cards was correctly picked. In that case all players are redirected to
the [GameOverScreen](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyOverview.tsx).
All Players can inspect the scoreboard.
Non-hosts can leave the current lobby and are then redirected to
the [LobbyOverview](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/LobbyOverview.tsx)
while the host also has the option to start the next round with the current players or wait for others to join.

Lastly,
the [ProfilePage](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-28/spotify-memory-client/blob/main/src/components/views/ProfilePage.tsx)
allows users to inspect their account and consume statistics about their past performance.


## Launch & Deployment

Firstly, make sure that your browser does not have any of the following properties enabled: 
- active vpn connections
- active popup-blockers
- active tracking-blockers
- active xyy was Diyar

Once these prerequisites are fulfilled you can start launching the application with: 

- npm run dev

  Runs the app in the development mode.
  Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

  The page will reload if you make edits.
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- npm run build

  Builds the app for production to the build folder.
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  Your app is ready to be deployed!
